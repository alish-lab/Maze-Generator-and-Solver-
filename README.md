# Maze Generator & Solver â€“ Dijkstra and A* Algorithms

This project is a graphical maze generator and solver built using **C++** and **SFML**. It visually demonstrates two popular pathfinding algorithms: **Dijkstra's algorithm** and **A\*** (A-Star). Users can generate random mazes and observe how each algorithm explores and solves the maze.

## Objectives

- Generate grid-based mazes with obstacles.
- Solve the maze using:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm (uninformed search)
  - A* Algorithm (informed search using heuristics)
- Visually compare performance and pathfinding behavior.

## Features

- Random maze generation
- Graphical visualization using SFML
- Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path finding
- A* algorithm using Manhattan distance heuristic
- Color-coded visualization of:
  - Walls
  - Visited cells
  - Final path

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Library: [SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
- Algorithm Concepts:
  - Priority queues (min-heap)
  - Manhattan distance heuristic
  - Graph traversal and shortest path

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (g++, MSVC, etc.)
- SFML installed and properly linked to your project
